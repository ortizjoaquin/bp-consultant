# b+p consultant
This is a project I'm working on for a info website for my aunt's architecture studio in France.
The idea is to make it all in plane html, css and javascript, and then start adding complexity, maybe addapting it to react.

# Info
The website is for info and contact only, the contact funcionality is based upon nodemailer, so you wont be able to test it as the keys to the transport account are inside an .env file and it's gitignored.
Right now it's lacking of any real content and is only a template (no images, no real text, etc).
