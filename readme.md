This is a project I'm working on for a info website for my aunt's architecture studio in France.

## About
I'm building the website on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Node.js as the environment for the server-side functionalities (wich by now it's only the e-mail sending).
The final project should also be fully responsive and mobile-first-designed.
Also, i'm thinking on adapting it to React in the future.

## Dependencies used:

- "body-parser"
- "dotenv"
- "express"
- "nodemailer"
- "nodemon" (devDependency)

## Heroku deployment:
You can check the deployment [in this link](https://bp-consultant.herokuapp.com/).
